</ul>
<h4>Toppings and Garnishes</h4>

    <li>Bean Sprouts</li>
    <li>Lime Wedges</li>

    <li>Thinly sliced Banana Blossoms</li>
    <li>Cilantro</li>
    <li>Thinly Sliced Red Cabbage</li>

<h4>Making Broth, Adding Spices</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Remove any dried outer leaves from the lemongrass and cut off the dried tips at
        the top.
        <p>We want to keep the bottom â…” of the stalk.</p>
        <p>With a blunt object, smash the lemongrass stalks to release the oils.</p>
        <p>Keep the lemongrass intact and add to the pot</p>
        <p>Peel the onion and cut it in half, peel the garlic and keep it intact</p>
        <p>so you can easily fish it out later when the broth is done. Put them in the pot.</p>
        <p>Add in the ginger slices, sugar, lime leaves, star anise into the pot</p>
    </li>
    <li>Add in 12 cups of water and set the heat to medium low and keep it at a low rolling boil.
        <p>Mix the shrimp paste with Â¼ cup of water and add it into the pot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Add in the fish sauce (add in half the amount of fish sauce first and then do a taste test to make sure it is
        not overly salty.
        <p>If it needs more salt, add in the rest of the fish sauce.</p>
        <p>Set a timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="break-text">You can make the sate chili sauce while you are waiting for the broth to cook and add it into
        the broth as soon as the sauce has cooled.
        <p>(Sate Chili Sauce steps below)</p>
        <p>Once 1 hour and 30 minutes passes, remove the beef shank and set it aside covered for use later</p>
        <p>If your broth reduced a lot, add 2-3 cups of water back to the broth</p>
    </li>
    <li class="break-text">Set the timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes again and cook the broth for a total of 3 hours. It
        doesn't hurt to cook
        this more than 3 hours though! ðŸ™‚
        <p>When the broth is done, discard the lime leaves, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, star anise and onion</p>
        <p>Do a taste test of the broth, to make sure it has enough salt. Add additional fish sauce to the broth for
            more
            flavour.</p>
        <p>Remove the pork hock and beef bones and set it aside covered for use later</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Prepping the Noodles and Meat & Building the Bun Bo Hue Noodle Bowl</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the noodles according to the package. To ensure you have springy bouncy noodles and not over cooked
        <p>mushy noodles, subtract 1 minute from the directions and try the noodles.</p>
        <p>If the noodles are still hard in the center, add 1 more minute to the cooking time and taste test again</p>
    </li>
    <li>Run the noodles under cold water once it is done cooking to remove the extra starches and to stop the cooking
        process.</li>
    <li class="break-text">[Optional] I like to mix 2 teaspoons of oil into the noodles while I am running cold water
        through it to prevent
        them from sticking together later on</li>
    <li>Thinly slice the beef shank, Vietnamese sausage (discard the banana leaf if it's wrapped in it) and
        <p> chop the pork shank and add it all to the bowl</p>
    </li>
    <li>Add in the noodles and the broth</li>
    <li>Add in garnishes and toppings and enjoy hot!</li>
</ol>
