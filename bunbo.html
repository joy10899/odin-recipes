    <p>Making Broth, Adding Spices</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove any dried outer leaves from the lemongrass and cut off the dried tips at the top. We want to keep the bottom â…” of the stalk. With a blunt object, smash the lemongrass stalks to release the oils. Keep the lemongrass intact and add to the pot
            Peel the onion and cut it in half, peel the garlic and keep it intact so you can easily fish it out later when the broth is done. Put them in the pot.
            Add in the ginger slices, sugar, lime leaves, star anise into the pot</li>
        <li>Add in 12 cups of water and set the heat to medium low and keep it at a low rolling boil.
            Mix the shrimp paste with Â¼ cup of water and add it into the pot.</li>
        <li>Add in the fish sauce (add in half the amount of fish sauce first and then do a taste test to make sure it is not overly salty. If it needs more salt, add in the rest of the fish sauce.
            Set a timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>You can make the sate chili sauce while you are waiting for the broth to cook and add it into the broth as soon as the sauce has cooled. (Sate Chili Sauce steps below)
            Once 1 hour and 30 minutes passes, remove the beef shank and set it aside covered for use later
            If your broth reduced a lot, add 2-3 cups of water back to the broth</li>
        <li>Set the timer for 1 hour and 30 minutes again and cook the broth for a total of 3 hours. It doesn't hurt to cook this more than 3 hours though! ðŸ™‚
            When the broth is done, discard the lime leaves, ginger, garlic, lemongrass, star anise and onion
            Do a taste test of the broth, to make sure it has enough salt. Add additional fish sauce to the broth for more flavour.
            Remove the pork hock and beef bones and set it aside covered for use later</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Prepping the Noodles and Meat & Building the Bun Bo Hue Noodle Bowl</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the noodles according to the package. To ensure you have springy bouncy noodles and not over cooked mushy noodles, subtract 1 minute from the directions and try the noodles. If the noodles are still hard in the center, add 1 more minute to the cooking time and taste test again</li>
        <li>Run the noodles under cold water once it is done cooking to remove the extra starches and to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>[Optional] I like to mix 2 teaspoons of oil into the noodles while I am running cold water through it to prevent them from sticking together later on</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the beef shank, Vietnamese sausage (discard the banana leaf if it's wrapped in it) and chop the pork shank and add it all to the bowl</li>
        <li>Add in the noodles and the broth</li>
        <li>Add in garnishes and toppings and enjoy hot!</li>
    </ol>
